# AlexaInventoryApplication
# This project provides some initial structure and patterns for developing an Alexa Skill.
# There are other sample Alexa projects that demonstrate the basics, however, 
# this project aims to go beyond a single file demo and explore a matured design.  In the end
# It works as a simple Item Inventory Application, helping the user take into account a list of 
# items he/she has, where they are, and when they were stored there.  Each item is stored in a 
# NoSQL database called DynamoDB.
# The application is to be deployed as an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda Function. 
# You will need an Amazon Web Services account to test the application.
